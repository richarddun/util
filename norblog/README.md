Script to read a range of OrbLog files generated by Citrix CloudBridge Diagnostic
bundle (log.tgz) and output to human readable text file. The log.tgz file is usually found within the orbital_current directory in a diagnostic bundle.

Requires Python 2.7

Usage : ./norblog /path/to/extracted/log/directory

Output : Script will write text logs to - orb_log.txt ; if the orb_log.txt file
already exists, a seperate file (orb_log_date&time_of_run.txt) will be created instead
